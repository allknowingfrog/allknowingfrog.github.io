### About Me

My name is Jeremiah Bohling. By day, I am the lead developer for [Sycamore Education](http://sycamoreeducation.com), and by night, I'm approximately one-half of the [Steno CRM](http://stenocrm.com/) team. I maintain LAMP stacks at Sycamore and Rails apps on the side. In my free time, I even dabble outside the realm of web development.

### So, you're not Jon?

Nope. We have an ancient tradition of "passing the conch" during stand-up meetings at my day job. He who holds the conch holds the floor, but we allow interruptions for worthwhile contributions. These are my worthwhile contributions.
