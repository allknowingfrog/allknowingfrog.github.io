### About Me

My name is Jeremiah Bohling. By day, I am the lead developer for [Sycamore Education](http://sycamoreeducation.com), and by night, the backend developer for [Clinically Pertinent Resources](https://www.cprmedicine.com). I maintain LAMP stacks at Sycamore, Rails apps at CPR, and in my free time, I even dabble outside the realm of web development in things like Rust. All provide interesting learning opportunities and this is a place to share the best ones.

### So, you're not Jon?

Nope. We have a long-standing tradition of "passing the conch" during stand-up meetings at my day job. In theory, he who holds the conch holds the floor. In practice, the conch is just a flat playground ball, and we allow interruptions for worthwhile contributions. Jon may have the conch, but I have something important to say.
