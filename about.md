### About Me

My name is Jeremiah Bohling, and I am a web developer. Ruby on Rails is my passion, but I have maintained LAMP stacks in the past along with a variety of scripting and maintenance tools. I am approximately one-third of Arctos Technologies, which is currently focused on [Halltogether](http://www.halltogether.io).

### So, you're not Jon?

Nope. We organized stand-up meetings around a conch at my first programming job. He who held the conch held the floor, but we allowed interruptions for worthwhile contributions. I hope these interruptions are worthwhile.
